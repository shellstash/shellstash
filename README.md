# ShellStash

**ShellStash** is a hacker-themed, terminal-style bookmark manager built in Python. It allows you to securely store, organize, and manage bookmarks with URLs, titles, categories, usernames, and passwords. Bookmarks are encrypted using Fernet (symmetric encryption), and the app features a command-line interface, drag-and-drop sorting, and category management.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Bookmarks are encrypted with a user-defined password using `cryptography.Fernet`.
- **Bookmark Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search bookmarks with auto-fetched titles.
- **Categories**: Organize bookmarks into categories, with sorting, renaming, and filtering via a tree view.
- **Credentials**: Store and copy usernames/passwords, with a show/hide toggle.
- **Navigation**: Drag-and-drop bookmarks, move up/down, and lock/unlock category boundaries.
- **Import/Export**: Import from HTML (browser-compatible) and export to HTML/TXT.
- **Customizable UI**: Toggle between "default" (dark green) and "alternative" (black-green) color schemes.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Execute commands (`new`, `edit`, `delete`, etc.) via a prompt.
- **Shortcuts**: Ctrl+N (new), Ctrl+O (open), Ctrl+D (delete), Ctrl+E (edit), Ctrl+T (tree).
- **Help System**: Detailed in-app guide with usage tips and troubleshooting.

Edit/Delete: Select a bookmark, use [edit]/[delete] or type edit/delete.

Search: Type in the search bar to filter by title/URL.

Categories: Use [tree] to sort/rename categories or toggle visibility.

Credentials: Select a bookmark, use [show] to view, [copy] to copy username/password.

Move Bookmarks: Drag-and-drop or use [â†‘]/[â†“] buttons. Toggle [ðŸ”’]/[ðŸ”“] for cross-category movement.

Security Notes
Bookmarks are stored in bookmarks.json.enc, encrypted with your password.

The salt.bin file is required for decryption.

TXT exports contain unencrypted passwords; handle with care.

No password recovery is available due to encryption design.

Import Issues: Ensure HTML files follow the Netscape bookmark format.

Category Movement: If bookmarks wonâ€™t move between categories, toggle to [].

Errors: Check the prompt for error messages or consult the [help] guide.
