# ShellStash
Version: 1.0 - First Blood

**ShellStash** is a hacker-themed, terminal-style bookmark manager built in Python. It allows you to securely store, organize, and manage bookmarks with URLs, titles, categories, usernames, and passwords. Bookmarks are encrypted using Fernet (symmetric encryption), and the app features a command-line interface, drag-and-drop sorting, and category management.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Bookmarks are encrypted with a user-defined password using `cryptography.Fernet`.
- **Bookmark Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search bookmarks with auto-fetched titles.
- **Categories**: Organize bookmarks into categories, with sorting, renaming, and filtering via a tree view.
- **Credentials**: Store and copy usernames/passwords, with a show/hide toggle.
- **Navigation**: Drag-and-drop bookmarks, move up/down, and lock/unlock category boundaries.
- **Import/Export**: Import from HTML (browser-compatible) and export to HTML/TXT.
- **Customizable UI**: Toggle between "default" (dark green) and "alternative" (black-green) color schemes.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Execute commands (`new`, `edit`, `delete`, etc.) via a prompt.
- **Shortcuts**: Ctrl+N (new), Ctrl+O (open), Ctrl+D (delete), Ctrl+E (edit), Ctrl+T (tree).
- **Help System**: Detailed in-app guide with usage tips and troubleshooting.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Required packages: `cryptography`, `pyperclip`, `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shellStash/shellstash.git
   cd shellstash

Run the application: ShellStash_V1.0_FirstBlood.py

### Usage
First Launch:
Set a password to encrypt your bookmarks. Confirm it by entering it twice.

The password will be required on subsequent launches to decrypt the bookmark file.

## Main Interface:
Command Buttons: Use [new], [edit], [delete], etc., for bookmark operations.

Search Bar: Type to filter bookmarks by title or URL.

Text Area: View bookmarks grouped by category. Click to select, drag to reorder.

Credential Display: View usernames/passwords (starred by default). Use [show] to reveal or [copy] to copy to clipboard.

Prompt: Enter commands (e.g., new, tree, help) at the $ prompt.

Navigation: Use [â†‘]/[â†“] to move bookmarks, [ðŸ”’]/[ðŸ”“] to toggle category lock, [swap] to change color schemes.

## Key Commands:
new: Create a new bookmark (Ctrl+N).

edit: Edit the selected bookmark (Ctrl+E).

delete: Delete the selected bookmark (Ctrl+D).

tree: Open the category tree window (Ctrl+T).

open: Open the selected bookmark in a browser (Ctrl+O).

copy: Copy the selected bookmarkâ€™s URL.

import/export: Import from HTML or export to HTML/TXT.

passwd: Change the encryption password.

help: View detailed documentation.

swap: Toggle color schemes.

exit: Save and close the app.

## Category Management:
Open the tree window ([tree] or Ctrl+T) to sort, rename, or filter categories.

Toggle category visibility with checkbuttons.

Use [ðŸ”’] to restrict bookmark movement within categories or [ðŸ”“] to allow cross-category moves.

## Example:
Add a bookmark: Click [new], enter https://example.com, leave title blank (fetches "Example Domain"), set category to "Test", add username/password.

Reorder: Drag the bookmark or use [â†‘]/[â†“].

Search: Type "example" to filter.

Export: Click [export] to save as HTML and TXT.


## Configuration
### Files:
bookmarks.json.enc: Encrypted bookmark data.

salt.bin: Random salt for encryption.

shellstash_config.json: Stores window size and position.

### Customization:
Edit color_schemes in shellstash.py to modify or add color schemes.

Adjust window geometry in shellstash_config.json for default size/position.



## Security Notes
Bookmarks are stored in bookmarks.json.enc, encrypted with your password.

The salt.bin file is required for decryption.

TXT exports contain unencrypted passwords; handle with care.

No password recovery is available due to encryption design.

## Troubleshooting
Wrong Password: Double-check your password. If lost, delete bookmarks.json.enc and salt.bin to start fresh (loses data).

Import Issues: Ensure HTML files follow the Netscape bookmark format.

Category Movement: If bookmarks wonâ€™t move between categories, toggle to [].

Errors: Check the prompt for error messages or consult the [help] guide.
